    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>We return to Italy now to bring you this typical and very simple dish.</p>
    <p>The idea is to give you a true piece of Italy in its most simple form, with only a few ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g of gnocchi</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>60 grams of parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of black pepper</li>
        <li>salad leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the gnocchi in a large pan of lightly salted, boiling water. Drain and reserve 200ml of the cooking water.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a large frying pan. Add the gnocchi, cheese and pepper as well as 150ml of the cooking water, raise the heat a little and stir vigorously until melted and the gnocchi is well coated.</li>
        <li>Pour in more of the reserved water if you like it saucier. Season with a little salt. Transfer the gnocchi to bowls and serve with a mixed salad, if you like.</li>
        <li>That is it, enjoy!</li>
